    "# CSS `position` Property Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "The `position` property in CSS specifies how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Positioning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `static` (default)\n",
    "Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div style=\"position: static; border: 1px solid blue;\">\n",
    "  This is static positioned (default).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `relative`\n",
    "The element is positioned relative to its normal position.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div style=\"position: relative; left: 30px; border: 1px solid green;\">\n",
    "  This is relative positioned (moved 30px right).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `absolute`\n",
    "The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (not static), or the initial containing block.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div style=\"position: relative; border: 1px solid black; height: 100px;\">\n",
    "  Parent (relative)\n",
    "  <div style=\"position: absolute; top: 10px; left: 20px; border: 1px solid red;\">\n",
    "    This is absolute positioned (10px from top, 20px from left of parent).\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. `fixed`\n",
    "The element is positioned relative to the browser window. It stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div style=\"position: fixed; bottom: 10px; right: 10px; background: yellow;\">\n",
    "  This is fixed positioned (always at bottom-right).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. `sticky`\n",
    "The element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div style=\"position: sticky; top: 0; background: lightgray;\">\n",
    "  This is sticky positioned (sticks to top when scrolling).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary Table\n",
    "\n",
    "| Value     | Description                                      |\n",
    "|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| static    | Default. Follows normal flow                     |\n",
    "| relative  | Offset from its normal position                  |\n",
    "| absolute  | Positioned relative to nearest positioned parent |\n",
    "| fixed     | Positioned relative to viewport                  |\n",
    "| sticky    | Scrolls with content, then sticks when needed    |\n",
